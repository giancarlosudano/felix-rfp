**What is the EU Data Boundary?**

Article • 01/02/2024

# Overview of the EU Data Boundary

The EU Data Boundary is a geographically defined boundary within which
Microsoft has committed to store and process Customer Data and personal
data for our Microsoft enterprise online services, including Azure,
Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Microsoft 365, subject to limited
circumstances where Customer Data and personal data will continue to be
transferred outside the EU Data Boundary. This documentation provides
details about those transfers. The online services included in the EU
Data Boundary commitment (referred to in this documentation as *EU Data
Boundary Services*) are identified in the Microsoft [Product
Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/PrivacyandSecurityTerms/MPSA)
as part of the services agreements.

## ） Important

> This EU Data Boundary documentation reflects the current state of the
> EU Data Boundary as of the date of publication. As noted in many cases
> in this documentation, we are continuing to deploy more services,
> service capabilities, and professional services data within the EU
> Data Boundary and will update this documentation accordingly and note
> the last updated date. Last updated: January 2, 2024.

## Customer Data

As defined in the Microsoft Product Terms, *Customer Data* means all
data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and software,
that are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, Customer through use
of the Online Service. Customer Data doesn\'t include *Professional
Services Data*. For clarity, Customer Data also doesn\'t include
information used to configure resources in the Online Services, such as
technical settings and resource names.

## Personal data in system-generated logs

Microsoft online services create system-generated logs as part of the
regular operation of the services. These logs continuously record system
activity over time to allow Microsoft to monitor whether systems are
operating as expected. "Logging" (the storage

and processing of logs) is essential to identify, detect, respond to,
and prevent

operational problems, policy violations, and fraudulent activity;
optimize system, network, and application performance; assist in
security investigations and resilience activities; and to comply with
laws and regulations. While the focus of these logs is on how systems
are operating and not on individual uses, when events in Microsoft cloud
services are initiated by user interaction with a cloud service, some
logs directly reflecting these events will -- and must in order to
fulfill their purposes -- contain fields that either identify or can
identify specific persons. These logs contain personal data.

Examples of system-generated logs that may contain personal data
include:

> Product and service usage data such as user activity logs
>
> Data specifically generated by the interaction of users with other
> systems

## Pseudonymization in system-generated logs

Pseudonymization, as defined in GDPR, Article 4(5), is the processing of
personal data so that it can no longer be attributed to a specific data
subject without using additional information. In other words, it takes
personally identifiable information within a data record and replaces it
with one or more artificial identifiers, or pseudonyms, thus protecting
the data subject\'s identity.

Microsoft requires all personal data in system-generated logs to be
pseudonymized. Microsoft uses various techniques to pseudonymize
personal data in system-generated logs, including encryption, masking,
tokenization, and data blurring. Regardless of the specific method of
pseudonymization, this protects user privacy by enabling authorized
Microsoft personnel to do their work using logs containing only
pseudonymized personal data. This enables our personnel to ensure the
quality, security, and reliability of our online services without
identifying or reidentifying users. For example, this enables DevOps
personnel to identify the extent of a service issue across regions,
including number of affected users in any given region, without these
personnel being able to identify or reidentify specific individuals. For
more information on the Microsoft

DevOps model, see Remote access to data stored and processed in the EU
Data Boundary. In the event of any unauthorized access to
system-generated logs, pseudonymization helps protect user privacy.
Controls on data that could enable reidentification of individuals from
pseudonymized logs are the same as controls applied to Customer Data.

In contrast, other methods of protecting user privacy that eliminate
personal data, such as anonymization, would permanently alter the data
such that it couldn\'t be used to identify unique numbers of events or
occurrences, and would eliminate the ability to reidentify individuals.
Since system-generated logs contain information about factual actions
such as the type, content or time of transactions conducted within the
Microsoft cloud, anonymization would compromise the historical record of
actions, compromising Microsoft's ability to ensure quality,
reliability, and security of our services.

Microsoft takes several steps to limit access to and usage of
system-generated logs.

Security controls include:

> Data minimization via implementation of retention policies set at the
> minimum retention time required for each type of log.
>
> Regular checks and scrubbing of system-generated logs to detect errors
> or policy non-conformance.
>
> Limited usage of system-generated logs solely for purposes related to
> service operations.
>
> Policies requiring access controls that limit the *rehydration* or
> *reidentification* of personal data such that it\'s returned to its
> original form.

# EU Data Boundary countries and datacenter locations

The EU Data Boundary consists of the countries in the European Union
(EU) and the

European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EU countries are Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria,

Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary,

Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,
Poland, Portugal,

Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden; and the EFTA countries
are Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.

The EU Data Boundary uses or may use Microsoft datacenters announced or
currently operating in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain,
Sweden, and Switzerland. In the future, Microsoft may establish
datacenters in additional countries located in the EU or EFTA to provide
EU Data Boundary Services.

# How to configure services for use in the EU Data Boundary

For EU Data Boundary Services, Customer Data and pseudonymized personal
data are stored and processed in datacenters located in countries in the
EU or EFTA. In some cases, customers can select the EU deployment region
directly; in others, the location is automatically assigned based on
customer location, billing address, or a customer decision to have their
environment reside in the EU Data Boundary.

**Continuing data transfers that apply to all EU Data Boundary
Services**

Article • 01/02/2024

There are scenarios where Microsoft will continue to transfer data out
of the EU Data

Boundary to meet cloud service operational requirements, where data
stored in the EU

Data Boundary will be accessed remotely by personnel located outside the
EU Data Boundary, and where a customer\'s use of EU Data Boundary
Services will result in data transfer out of the EU Data Boundary to
achieve the customer\'s desired outcomes. Microsoft ensures that any
Customer Data and pseudonymized personal data transfers outside of the
EU Data Boundary are protected by security safeguards detailed in our
services agreements and product documentation.

# Remote access to data stored and processed in the EU Data Boundary

Microsoft cloud services are built, operated, kept secure, and
maintained by expert teams from around the world to provide customers
with the highest level of service [quality, support, security, and
reliability. This model (known as the Microsoft DevOps model) puts
developers and operations staff together working in tandem
to](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops/)
continuously build, maintain, and provide the services. This section
describes how Microsoft both minimizes this remote access to Customer
Data and pseudonymized personal data and restricts such access when it
needs to occur.

Microsoft uses a multilayered approach to protect Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data from unauthorized access by Microsoft
personnel, which consists of both employees of Microsoft and its
subsidiaries and contract staff from third party organizations who
assist Microsoft employees. To access Customer Data or pseudonymized
personal data, Microsoft personnel must have a background check on file
in good standing, in addition to utilizing multifactor authentication as
part of Microsoft standard security requirements.

When Microsoft personnel need to access Customer Data or pseudonymized
personal data stored on Microsoft systems inside the EU Data Boundary
from outside the boundary (considered a transfer of data under European
privacy law although the data remains within Microsoft datacenter
infrastructure in the EU Data Boundary) we rely on technology that
ensures this type of transfer is secure, with controlled access and no
persistent storage at the remote access point. When such a data transfer
is required,

Microsoft uses state-of-the-art encryption to protect Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data at rest and in transit. For more
information, see [Encryption and key management
overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-encryption).

## How Microsoft protects Customer Data

We design our services and processes to maximize the ability of DevOps
personnel to operate the services without requiring access to Customer
Data, employing automated tooling to identify and repair issues. In rare
cases when a service is down or in need of a repair that can't be
effectuated with automated tooling, authorized Microsoft personnel may
require remote access to data stored within the EU Data Boundary,
including Customer Data. There\'s no default access to Customer Data;
access is provided to Microsoft personnel only when a task requires it.
Access to Customer Data must be for an appropriate purpose, must be
limited to the amount and type of Customer Data required to achieve the
appropriate purpose, and where the purpose can only be achieved through
this level of access. Microsoft uses just-in-time (JIT) access approvals
which are granted only for as long as is necessary to achieve that
purpose. Microsoft also relies on role-based access control (RBAC),
where individual access is subject to strict requirements, such as the
need-to-know principle, mandatory continual training, and oversight by
one or more managers.

Microsoft personnel that have access to Customer Data operate from
secure admin workstations (SAWs). SAWs are limited-function computers
that reduce the risk of compromise from malware, phishing attacks, bogus
websites, and pass-the-hash (PtH) attacks, among other security risks,
and are enabled with countermeasures intended to make data exfiltration
difficult. For example, Microsoft personnel working on SAWs have
restricted access to the internet on such devices and are unable to
access external or removable media because those capabilities are
blocked in the SAW implementation. The Microsoft SAW and high-risk
environment program received CSO50 awards from csoonline.com in
[2022](https://www.csoonline.com/award/642551/us-cso-50-award-8-2022.html),
[2020,](https://www.csoonline.com/award/642368/us-cso-50-award-6-2020.html)
and
[2019](https://www.csoonline.com/award/642269/us-cso-50-award-5-2019.html).

In addition to the controls described previously, customers may
establish additional access controls for many Microsoft cloud services
by enabling Customer Lockbox. Implementation of the Customer Lockbox
feature varies slightly by service, but

Customer Lockbox generally ensures that Microsoft personnel can\'t
access Customer

Data to perform service operations without the customer\'s explicit
approval. See

[Customer Lockbox in Office 365, Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure,
and Customer Lockbox in Power Platform and Dynamics 365 for examples of
Customer Lockbox
in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/about-lockbox)
action.

Access to Customer Data is also logged and monitored by Microsoft.
Microsoft performs regular audits to review and confirm that access
management measures are working in accordance with policy requirements,
including Microsoft\'s contractual commitments.

## How Microsoft protects pseudonymized personal data in system-generated logs

Currently, to access pseudonymized personal data stored in the EU Data
Boundary,

Microsoft personnel may use either a SAW or a virtual desktop
infrastructure (VDI). The SAW-specific security measures described in
the preceding section also apply when using a SAW to access
pseudonymized personal data. When using a VDI to access pseudonymized
personal data in the EU Data Boundary, Microsoft enforces access
limitations to provide a secure environment for data access. As with
SAWs, the list of utilities that are allowed on the VDIs are limited and
are subject to rigorous security tests before being certified to run on
the VDIs. When a VDI is used, pseudonymized personal data in the EU Data
Boundary is accessed through virtual machines that are hosted on a
physical machine located in the EU Data Boundary and no data persists
outside of the EU Data Boundary.

Per our standard policies, bulk transfers of data outside the EU Data
Boundary are prohibited, and VDI users can only access preapproved URL
destinations. In addition, Microsoft personnel who use the VDI
environment do not have administrative access to the physical machines
located in the EU Data Boundary.

# Customer-initiated data transfers

## Transfers customers initiate as part of service capabilities

The EU Data Boundary isn\'t intended to interfere with or restrict the
service outcomes customers intend when they use our services. Thus, if a
customer administrator or user takes an action in the services that
initiates a data transfer out of the EU Data Boundary, Microsoft won\'t
restrict such customer-initiated transfers from happening; doing so
would disrupt normal business operations for customers. User-initiated
data transfers outside of the EU Data Boundary can happen for a variety
of reasons, for example:

> A user accesses data stored within the EU Data Boundary or interacts
> with a service while outside of the EU Data Boundary area.
>
> A user chooses to communicate with other users physically located
> outside the EU
>
> Data Boundary. Examples include sending an email or SMS message,
> initiating a Teams chat or voice communication such as a Public
> Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) call, voice mail, cross
> geo-meetings, and so on.
>
> A user configures a service to move data out of the EU Data Boundary.
>
> A user elects to combine EU Data Boundary Services with other
> Microsoft or thirdparty offerings or connected experiences subject to
> separate terms from those that apply to the EU Data Boundary Services
> (for example by utilizing an optional Bingbacked experience available
> through the Microsoft 365 Applications, or by using an available
> connector to sync data from within an EU Data Boundary Service to an
> account the user may have with a provider other than Microsoft).
>
> A customer administrator elects to connect EU Data Boundary Services
> to other services offered by Microsoft or a third party, where those
> other services are subject to separate terms from those that apply to
> the EU Data Boundary Services (for example by configuring an EU Data
> Boundary Service to send queries to Bing, or by establishing a
> connection between an EU Data Boundary Service and a service hosted at
> a provider other than Microsoft with which the customer also has an
> account).
>
> A user acquires and uses an app from an app store presented within an
> EU Data Boundary Service (the Teams store, for example), where the app
> is subject to terms separate from those applicable to the EU Data
> Boundary Service, such as the end user license agreement from the app

## Fulfilling GDPR data subject rights requests worldwide

Microsoft has implemented systems to enable our customers to respond to
data subject rights requests (DSRs) under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) (for example, to delete personal data in response to a
request under Article 17 of the GDPR) as customers determine is
appropriate, and these systems are available to customers worldwide. To
enable our customers to maintain GDPR compliance, DSR signals that
include user identifiers must be processed globally to ensure that all
data related to a data subject is deleted or exported as requested. When
our customer determines data deletion is appropriate in response to a
data subject requesting that their personal data be deleted, all
personal data related to that data subject must be located and deleted
from all of Microsoft\'s data stores, both within and outside of the EU
Data Boundary.

Similarly, when an export request is submitted by a customer
administrator, Microsoft must export to the storage location specified
by the customer admin, even if outside the EU Data Boundary, all the
personal data about that data subject. For more information, see [GDPR:
Data Subject Requests
(DSRs).](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/gdpr-dsr)

# Professional Services data

When customers provide Microsoft with data in the course of engaging
with Microsoft for support or paid consulting services, that data is
Professional Services Data, as defined in the [Microsoft Products and
Services Data Protection Addendum
(DPA)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA).
Professional Services Data is currently stored in United States-based
Microsoft datacenters.

Access to Professional Services Data by Microsoft personnel during a
support engagement is limited to approved support management systems
utilizing security and authentication controls, including two-factor
authentication and virtualized environments, as necessary. Other
Microsoft personnel may only access Professional Services Data
associated with a specific engagement by providing necessary business
justification and manager approval. The data is encrypted both in
transit and at rest.

Professional Services Data provided, obtained, and processed during a
paid consulting engagement is accessed by the team the customer engages
to provide the purchased services. Work is in progress to allow EU
customers to specify that their Professional Services Data should be
stored and processed in the EU Data Boundary.

# Protecting customers

To protect against global cybersecurity threats, Microsoft must run
security operations globally. To do this, Microsoft transfers (as
detailed in Security Operations) limited pseudonymized personal data
outside of the EU Data Boundary and, in rare situations, limited
Customer Data. Malicious actors are operating globally, launching geo
distributed attacks, using coordinated stealth, and evading detection.
Analyzing contextual threat data across geo boundaries allows Microsoft
security services to protect customers by providing high quality,
automated security detections, protections, and response.

The results of this cross-boundary analysis feed multiple protection
scenarios, including alerting customers of malicious activity, attacks,
or attempted breaches.

Having strong security protections in place benefits our customers and
the computing ecosystem and supports regulatory obligations in the
security of Customer Data, pseudonymized personal data, and critical
infrastructure. Consistent with both GDPR and the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights, Microsoft's approach provides value by promoting
privacy, data protection, and security.

Access to the limited Customer Data and pseudonymized personal data
transferred out of the EU for security operations is restricted to
Microsoft security personnel, and the usage is restricted to security
purposes, including detecting, investigating, mitigating, and responding
to security incidents. Transferred Customer Data and pseudonymized
personal data are protected through encryption and access restrictions.
More information about access to data stored and processed in the EU
Data Boundary is covered earlier in this article.

Examples of customer-facing capabilities provided by Microsoft through
usage of the cross-boundary signals include:

> To provide protection against sophisticated modern security threats,
> Microsoft relies on its advanced analytics capabilities, including
> artificial intelligence, to analyze aggregate security-related data,
> including activity logs, to protect against, detect, investigate,
> respond to, and remediate these attacks. Limited Customer Data and
> globally consolidated pseudonymized personal data is used to create
> statistical summaries to reduce false positive results, improve
> effectiveness, and create unique machine learning models for advanced
> detections of both known and unknown threats in near real-time. Global
> models allow us to fine-tune and enable custom models for specific
> operations. Without this centralized analytics capability across
> global data, the efficiency of these services would degrade
> significantly, and we would not be able to protect our customers nor
> provide a consistent user experience.
>
> The hyperscale cloud enables diverse, ongoing analysis of
> security-related systemgenerated logs without prior knowledge of a
> specific attack. In many cases, global system-generated logs enable
> Microsoft or its customers to stop previously unknown attacks, while
> in other cases Microsoft and customers can use systemgenerated logs to
> identify threats that were not detected initially but can be found
> later based on new threat intelligence.
>
> Detecting a compromised enterprise user, by identifying logins into a
> single account from multiple geographic regions, within a brief period
> (known as \"impossible travel\" attacks). To enable protection from
> these types of scenarios, Microsoft security products (and as
> applicable, security operations and threat intelligence teams) process
> and store data such as Microsoft Entra authentication system-generated
> logs centrally across geos.
>
> Detecting data exfiltration from the enterprise, by aggregating
> several signals of malicious access to data storage from various
> locations, a technique used by malicious actors to fly under the
> detection radar (known as \"low and slow\" attacks).

To minimize the privacy impact of this work, Microsoft\'s security
threat hunter teams limit ongoing transfers to system-generated logs and
service configuration information necessary to detect and investigate
early indicators of malicious activity or breach. This pseudonymized
data is consolidated and stored primarily in the United States but may
include other data center regions worldwide for threat detection work as
described previously. Pseudonymized personal data is transferred and
protected in accordance with the terms of the DPA and applicable
contractual commitments. In the rare instances where Customer Data is
accessed or transferred as a result of security investigation, it is
done so through elevated approvals and controls as set forth in the How
Microsoft protects Customer Data section earlier in this article

## Security Operations

Microsoft security operations use a collection of internal services to
monitor, investigate, and respond to threats facing the platforms
customers rely on for their daily operations. The cross-geo boundary
pseudonymized personal data or limited Customer Data processed for these
operations helps block malicious attempts against the cloud
infrastructure and Microsoft online services.

Pseudonymized personal data processed for security purposes is
transferred to any

[Azure region worldwide. This enables Microsoft's security operations,
like the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), to provide security
services 24 hours a day,
365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc?rtc=2) days a year in an
efficient and effective manner in response to worldwide threats. The
data is used in monitoring, investigations, and response to security
incidents within Microsoft's platform, products, and services,
protecting customers and Microsoft from threats to their security and
privacy. For example, when an IP address or phone number is determined
to be used in fraudulent activities, it is published globally to block
access from any workloads using it.

> Security analysts access aggregated data from locations around the
> globe, as MSRC has a follow-the-sun operation model, with distributed
> expertise and skills to provide continuous monitoring and response for
> security investigations, including, but not limited to the following
> scenarios: Customer identified malicious activity in their tenant or
> subscriptions and contacted Microsoft support for help resolving the
> incident.
>
> MSRC has a clear indication(s) of compromise in a customer tenant,
> subscription, or resource and notifies the customer, helps
> investigate, and respond to the incident, following approval from the
> customer.
>
> Through the course of the investigation, if a customer-impacting
> privacy incident is identified, MSRC would, following a strict
> protocol, do further investigation to support the notification and
> response to the privacy-impacting incident.
>
> Sharing of threat intelligence and investigation details among
> Microsoft internal security teams for agile response and remediation.

More information about access to data stored and processed in the EU
Data Boundary is covered earlier in this article.

## Security Threat Intelligence

Microsoft [threat
intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/topic/threat-intelligence/?sort-by=newest-oldest&date=any)
services monitor, investigate, and respond to threats facing customer
environments. Data collected for security investigations may include
pseudonymized personal data in system-generated logs and limited
Customer Data. This data is used to help block malicious attempts
against our customers' cloud infrastructures and provide timely threat
intelligence and indications of compromise to organizations, helping
them to increase their level of protection.

For threat investigations where evidence of a [Nation State
Threat](https://www.microsoft.com/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023)
or other malicious actions by sophisticated actors is detected, the
Microsoft teams gathering threat intelligence, like the [Microsoft
Threat Intelligence
Center](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/topic/threat-intelligence/)
(MSTIC), alert customers of the noted activity. MSTIC can identify
malicious activity through globally consolidated system-generated logs
and diagnostic data collected from various Microsoft products and
services, in conjunction with expert analysis by MSTIC personnel.

Access by geographically dispersed analyst teams to globally
consolidated systemgenerated logs for security purposes is critically
important to timely identification of an attack or breach, providing a
non-interrupted investigation. MSTIC analysts possess specific attacker
knowledge and skills that cannot simply be replicated in other regions
as they may have specific regional adversary expertise. As a result,
MSTIC analysis operations necessarily cross geopolitical boundaries to
provide customers with the highest level of expertise. For additional
information on access controls, see Remote access to data stored and
processed in the EU Data Boundary earlier in this article.

Providing customers with the best threat intelligence requires MSTIC to
leverage global signals for scenarios like:

> Malicious Nation State activities that are used to achieve national
> intelligence objectives.
>
> Malicious Nation State activities that use commodity malware and
> tactics in destructive, unrecoverable attacks, or are used to mask the
> identity of the attacker (false flag) and provide plausible
> deniability. Malicious criminal activities that are used in illicit
> financial extortion schemes (for example, ransomware attacks against
> civilian critical resources or infrastructure).

# Services in preview/trials

Only paid Microsoft services that are generally available are included
in the EU Data

Boundary. Services that are in preview or made available as free trials
aren\'t included.

# Deprecated services

Services that, as of December 31, 2022, Microsoft has announced as being
deprecated [aren\'t included in the EU Data Boundary. Microsoft cloud
services follow the Modern Lifecycle Policy, and in most cases when
we\'ve announced a service as being
depreca](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/policies/modern)ted
we\'ve also recommended an alternative or successor product offering
that is in scope for the EU Data Boundary. For example, Microsoft Stream
(Classic) is an enterprise video service for Microsoft 365 being
replaced by Stream (on SharePoint). While specific deprecation dates for
Stream (Classic) haven\'t yet been announced, customers have been
advised that Stream (Classic) will be deprecated in 2024. Migration
guidance and public preview tools are available to assist customers in
migrating to Stream (on SharePoint), which is within the EU Data
Boundary.

# On-premises software and client applications

Data stored in on-premises software and client applications isn\'t
included in the EU Data Boundary, as Microsoft doesn\'t control what
happens in customers\' on-premises environments. Diagnostic data
generated from the use of on-premises software and client applications
is also not included in the EU Data Boundary.

# Directory data

Microsoft may replicate limited Microsoft Entra directory data from
Microsoft Entra (including username and email address) outside the EU
Data Boundary to provide the service.

# Network Transit

To reduce routing latency and to maintain routing resiliency, Microsoft
uses variable network paths that may occasionally result in routing of
customer traffic outside of the EU Data Boundary. This may include load
balancing by proxy servers.

# Service and Platform Quality and Management

Microsoft personnel may require some pseudonymized personal data from
systemgenerated logs to be consolidated globally to ensure the services
are running efficiently and to compute and monitor real-time, global
quality metrics for the services. A limited amount of pseudonymized
personal data such as object IDs or primary unique IDs (PUIDs), can be
included in these transfers and are used to address various service
operability and management issues. Examples include calculating the
number of users affected by a service-impacting event to determine its
pervasiveness and severity or calculating monthly active users (MAU) and
daily active users (DAU) of the services to ensure billing calculations
based on this data are complete and accurate.

Pseudonymized personal data transferred for MAU and DAU calculation
purposes is retained outside the EU Data Boundary for only as long as
needed to compile aggregate analytics.

# Azure services

## Azure Bot Service

[Azure Bot
Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/) provides
a collection of libraries, tools, and services that let customers build,
test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots. The Bot Service control plane
uses Azure Resource Manager to route requests, and this means some
Customer Data is processed globally, due to Azure Resource Manager\'s
current architectural constraints, as described in Services temporarily
excluded from the EU Data Boundary. Bot name, bot icon URL, and any
configuration settings for a customer\'s chosen externally integrated
service (for example, application credentials issued by Facebook for the
bot to interact with Facebook APIs) may be processed globally but are
stored at rest in the EU Data Boundary when the customer\'s bot is
configured with regional settings specifying that it should store and
process pseudonymized personal data within a region in the EU Data
Boundary.

## Azure Communication Services

For [Azure Communication
Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/overview),
when a customer end-user makes a Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN) call to an emergency number (for example, 112), a temporary
number is assigned to that user from a pool of numbers in case a
callback is needed. The temporary number and the associated User ID are
replicated to the United States and persists for 60 minutes in case a
callback is needed.

## Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs temporarily transfers some pseudonymized personal
data from the EU. [Azure DevTest
Labs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview)
is a service for creating, using, and managing
infrastructure-asa-service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs) and
platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environments in labs. When customers create
or modify resources in Azure DevTest Labs, the primary unique ID (PUID)
of the lab, considered pseudonymized personal data, is stored in the
United States. Work is ongoing to rearchitect portions of Azure DevTest
Labs to store the PUID regionally.

## Azure Monitor: Activity Log and Application Change Analysis

[Azure Monitor:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/)
[Activity
Log](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log?tabs=powershell),
and [Application Change
Analysis:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/change/change-analysis)
Except for Activity Log and Application Change Analysis, which have a
dependency on Azure Resource Manager, Azure Monitor services can store
and process Customer Data and pseudonymized personal data in the EU (as
described in Configuring Azure non-regional services for the EU Data
Boundary). *Azure Monitor Activity Log* provides insights into Azure
subscription-level events by every Azure resource provider. This
includes information such as when a resource in the subscription is
created or modified and when a resource is started or stopped. This data
will include the email address of the user who initiated the activity.
Since subscriptions aren't bound to a region, the Activity log is
geo-distributed to multiple regions worldwide which will transfer it out
of the EU Data Boundary. Data in the Activity log is stored for 30 days
in most cases. *Application Change Analysis* builds on Azure Resource
Graph to provide insights into changes across multiple infrastructure
and application deployment layers. The dependencies on Resource Graph
and Azure Resource Manager require data to be stored and processed
globally. Customer Data that will be transferred includes
customer-provided resource properties that are stored by Azure Resource
Graph, in addition to pseudonymized personal data such as session tokens
and primary unique IDs (PUIDs). This data may be stored or processed in
any Microsoft datacenter within Azure public regions. All of these data
transfers are due to the dependencies on Azure Resource Manager, as
described in Services temporarily excluded from the EU Data Boundary.

## Azure Monitor: Application Insights

Azure Portal's usage of Application Insights temporarily transfers some
pseudonymized personal data from the EU. [Application
Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
is an Azure Monitor feature that enables Application Performance
Management (APM) for live web applications. It stores and processes all
Customer Data in the Geo selected by the customer. Azure Portal
telemetry collected by Application Insights using the [Application
Insights JavaScript
SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript-sdk?tabs=javascriptwebsdkloaderscript)
includes pseudonymized personal data such as session IDs from Portal
users across all regions and this is stored and processed in the United
States. This data transfer is temporary and due to the Azure portal\'s
dependency on Azure Resource Manager, as described in Services
temporarily excluded from the EU Data Boundary.

## Azure Serial Console

[Azure Serial
Console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview)
feature (part of Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Virtual Machine Scale
Sets): Serial Console in the Azure portal provides access to a
text-based console for Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale sets.
It stores all Customer Data at rest in the Geo selected by the customer,
but when used through the Azure portal may process console commands and
responses outside of the Geo for the sole purpose of providing the
Console experience inside the Portal. This data transfer is temporary
and due to the Azure portal\'s dependency on Azure Resource Manager, as
described in Services temporarily excluded from the EU Data Boundary.

## Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell temporarily transfers some pseudonymized personal data from
the EU.

[Cloud
Shell ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview)provides
an interactive browser-based shell for managing Azure resources. The
primary unique ID (PUID), considered pseudonymized personal data, is
leveraged for live site investigations and is globally stored. Work is
ongoing to rearchitect portions of Cloud Shell to store the PUID
regionally. Cloud Shell can store and process Customer Data and all
other pseudonymized personal data in the EU Data Boundary, as described
in Configuring Azure non-regional services.

# Dynamics 365 and Power Platform services

## Power Automate

[Power Automate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/)
temporarily transfers some pseudonymized personal data from the EU.

Power Automate enables users to automate tasks and processes using
workflows. Enterprise users have two options: solution-aware workflows
that they can share, or personal, non-solution workflows. Non-solution
workflows are created in per-user resource groups with resource group
names containing the user's object ID being globally replicated in Azure
Resource Manager, as described in Services temporarily excluded from the
EU Data Boundary. Work is in progress to replace non-solution workflows
with solution-aware workflows in the future. Until then, customers can
ensure their pseudonymized personal data resides within the EU Data
Boundary by requiring [solution-aware
flows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/overview-solution-flows)
for their environment.

## Microsoft Copilot Studio

[Microsoft Copilot
Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/)
transfers some pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data Boundary.
As part of service operations, when DevOps personnel run queries that
combine system-generated data stored inside and outside the EU Data
Boundary, transient egress of pseudonymized personal data may occur
during the duration of the query runtime.

# Microsoft 365 services

## Exchange Online

[Exchange

Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management
service. Microsoft Entra ID helps customers, and their employees, access
external resources (such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, other SaaS
applications) and internal resources (such as on premises applications)
from any location on the planet. Microsoft Entra ID operates as a
non-regional service. Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) provides
business-to-consumer (B2C) identity as a service. It allows businesses
to build customer-facing applications and manage customer, consumer, and
citizen access to these B2C applications. Like Microsoft Entra ID, Azure
AD B2C operates as a non-regional service. This section provides details
on service components that cause Customer Data to be processed globally,

## Microsoft Teams

### Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Services

[Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
Services:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/pstn-connectivity)
Microsoft Teams enables customers to interconnect with the Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Services to support calls and meeting
participation from mobile and fixed-line telephones. When customers use
Teams for PSTN interconnection, the following data transfers out of the
EU Data Boundary are triggered to support worldwide calling:

> [Microsoft Teams Phone
> System](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/pstn-connectivity):
> The Teams Phone System allows Teams users to make and receive calls to
> and from the PSTN by assigning numbers to users and voice-related
> applications. A globally replicated mapping of assigned PSTN numbers
> enables Teams Phone System to route calls to the right users
> efficiently. This approach supports traveling and remote users and
> global incoming calls, enabling the service to route incoming calls in
> real time regardless of the current location of the called user.
> Customer Data transferred from the EU Data Boundary and replicated
> globally: PSTN phone numbers and required information for routing.
>
> [Teams Operator Connect
> Plan:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/operator-connect-plan)
> EU customers can choose to use a third-party PSTN provider that
> participates in the Teams Operator Connect Plan. These third-party
> providers may use call specific global unique IDs (GUIDs) in the
> Operator Connect portal to retrieve phone number and emergency address
> location information associated with a call. This information enables
> third-party providers to manage Teams PSTN related data for billing
> purposes and call troubleshooting. The Operator Connect portal is
> hosted in the United States and as a result, phone number and location
> information are processed in the United States.
>
> [Call-specific
> IDs:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/caller-id-policies)
> When users make a call using Teams, some call-specific IDs are stored
> for up to three days in the United States for call troubleshooting,

> represent the call itself, and IDs for each participant in the call.
> These participant IDs are specific to the call and not shared across
> calls, nor do they represent the Teams user accounts for the call
> participants.

### Emergency Calls

[Emergency
Calls:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing)
When a Teams user makes an emergency call (for example, by dialing

112), a temporary number is assigned to that user from a pool of numbers
managed by Microsoft. The temporary number is different than the number
assigned to that user by the tenant. The temporary number is replicated
to the United States and stored for 60 minutes in case a call back is
needed. Customer Data transferred to and temporarily replicated in the
United States where it persists for 60 minutes: temporary phone numbers
created when an emergency phone call is made.

### Voicemail, Auto Attendant, and Call Queue greetings

[Voicemail, Auto Attendant, and Call Queue
greetings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail):
If a caller outside of the EU Data Boundary reaches the voicemail,
auto-attendant, or call queue greeting of a user or voice application
inside of the EU Data Boundary, that greeting is stored for 30 days in
the caller\'s region. The greeting is stored for performance caching in
case it\'s reaccessed for other calls from the same region during the
30-day period. This service applies to both PSTN and Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) calls. Customer Data transferred and temporarily cached
in the location of the user accessing the voice greeting: voicemail,
auto-attendant, and call queue greetings.

### Messaging Thread Service

[Messaging Thread
Service:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview)
Chat data may be stored outside the EU Data Boundary in federated
(external user) chat scenarios. A Teams chat thread is created when an
initiator sends the first message to a specific user or group of users
or when a meeting organizer schedules a meeting. Customer Data leaves
the EU Data Boundary to support this crosstenant scenario. Customer Data
transferred to and stored in the location of the user who started the
chat, or in the case of a meeting, the location of the meeting
organizer: chat or message data.

Some services include capabilities that are optional (in some cases
requiring a customer subscription), and where customer administrators
can choose to enable or disable these capabilities for their service
tenancies. If made available to and used by a customer\'s users, these

Research is a legacy text selection feature in Microsoft Word, Excel,
and PowerPoint that was replaced by the [Modern Translation
Experience](https://support.microsoft.com/office/064e938e-0af4-4f35-bd1d-04feb45af9aa)
in 2017. The feature allows a user to select text to look up meanings,
translations, or thesaurus entries for the selected text. The Modern
features have replaced the legacy feature by default and the Modern
feature stores and processes Customer Data within the EU Data Boundary.
Administrators can re-enable the legacy feature if they don\'t want the
Modern experience. Customer Data transferred: any user text that is
entered into the feature. Use of the legacy feature sends Customer Data
to the United States or Southeast Asia for processing.

## Microsoft Teams

### Shared Channel Invitations

[Shared Channel
Invitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/shared-channels):
For tenants that have enabled Azure Active Directory B2B Direct Connect
and configured a cross-tenant relationship with a tenant that has users
outside of the EU Data Boundary, when a user within the EU Data Boundary
is invited as a guest for Teams in another tenancy, the EU guest user\'s
email address and hosting company name are temporarily stored in the
United States. Once the EU tenant accepts the invitation, the email
address is replaced with the user\'s pseudonymous user identifier. If
the EU user declines the invitation, the email address and company name
pair are deleted. Customer Data leaves the EU Data Boundary to support
this crosstenant scenario for shared channels. Examples of Customer Data
that is transferred: guest user\'s email address and hosting company\'s
name. Customer Data is temporarily stored in the United States. If an EU
tenant invites a user from another tenancy (guest tenant), some data is
stored in the location of the guest tenant.

### Azure Bot Services by Teams App

The use of [Azure Bot
Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots)
has a technical limitation that each bot can only have a single global
endpoint. For Teams first-party bots, requests are sent to the global
endpoint and then rerouted to a regional endpoint near the user.
Customer administrators can disable applications individually or by
disabling first-party applications. Examples of Customer Data that is
transferred: All Customer Data collected by the bot. Customer Data is
processed at the endpoint that is set by the bot creator.

Regional endpoints include Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United
States.

### Telephone Number Management

[Telephone Number
Management:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-landing-page)
Customer administrators can give a custom name to their orders for new
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) numbers or number porting,
meant to help them to quickly identify those orders; for example, \"10
new numbers for Vienna office\". Customer Data transferred to and
processed in North America: Custom names given by customers.

## Microsoft Forms

[Microsoft
Forms:](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/online-surveys-polls-quizzes)
If a Microsoft 365 customer purchases the [Advanced Data
Residency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/advanced-data-residency)
add-on, a mapping of their user IDs to tenant ID is stored in the United
States while the data is migrated to the local data center. This data is
deleted once the data migration is complete, typically within 30 days.

# Security services

## Microsoft Entra ID

### Tenant takeover

[Tenant
takeover](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/domains-admin-takeover#external-admin-takeover):
When a [self-service user signs
up](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-self-service-signup)
for a cloud service that uses Microsoft Entra ID, they\'re added to an
unmanaged Microsoft Entra directory based on their email domain. The
geo-location of that tenant might vary. Each user created in that tenant
is an administrator for their own account. To manage the tenant more
effectively, it can be converted to a regular Microsoft Entra ID tenant
with a global administrator.

During the process to take over the tenant, transactions may cross a
geo-boundary. After conversion, the tenant meets all geo residency
requirements based on the Country or region of the tenant.

### Multi-tenant administration

[Multi-tenant
administration:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/overview)
An organization may choose to create a multi-tenant organization within
Microsoft Entra ID. For example, a customer can invite users to their
tenant in a B2B context. A customer can create a multi-tenant SaaS
application that allows other third-party tenants to provision the
application in the third-party tenant. A customer can make two or more
tenants affiliated with one another and act as a single tenant in
certain scenarios, such as multi-tenant organization (MTO) formation,
tenant to tenant sync, and shared e-mail domain sharing. Administrator
configuration and use of multi-tenant collaboration may occur with
tenants outside of the EU Data Boundary resulting in some Customer Data,
such as user and device account data, usage data, and service
configuration (application, policy, and group) being stored and
processed in the location of the collaborating tenant. Similarly, if a
user member of an EU Data Boundary tenant collaborates with a non-EU
Data Boundary tenant, their usage data will egress outside the EU Data
Boundary.

### Application Proxy

[Application
Proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy)
allows customers to access both cloud and on-premises applications
through an external URL or an internal application portal. Customers may
choose advanced routing configurations that would cause Customer Data to
egress outside of the EU Data Boundary. This data includes user account
data, usage data, and application configuration data.

### Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with Multifactor Authentication

[Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with Multifactor
Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks):
Multifactor authentication is a process in which users are prompted
during the sign-in process for another form of identification, such as a
code on their cellphone or a fingerprint scan. During the authentication
process, phone calls or text messaging platforms like SMS, RCS, or
WhatsApp rely on a network that global providers operate. Device
vendorspecific services, such as push notifications from Apple or
Google, may be outside of Europe. As a result, Public Switched Telephone
Network (PSTN) phone numbers and authentications using the Authenticator
App including Passwordless may be processed outside of the EU Data
Boundary. Administrators can configure their Microsoft Entra tenant with
[OATH
tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-oath-tokens)
to ensure Customer Data remains within the EU Data Boundary.

# Azure services

## Azure non-regional services

Azure non-regional services (complete list available here: [Azure
Products by
Region)](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all)
are services that have no dependency on a specific Azure region and
don\'t currently let customers specify a region for deployment.
Non-regional services are being rearchitected to be included in the EU
Data Boundary. For some services, this work is already complete. See
Configuring Azure non-regional services for the EU Data Boundary for a
list of these services, including information on how to configure them
to store and process Customer Data and pseudonymized personal data in
the EU Data Boundary.

The following sections provide information about the other non-regional
services for which rearchitecting is still in progress and explain what
Customer Data or pseudonymized personal data is transferred outside of
the EU Data Boundary, why those transfers occur, and how the transferred
data is protected while outside the EU.

### Azure Resource Manager

[Azure Resource
Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)
is the deployment and management service for Azure. To provide maximum
availability and performance, Azure Resource Manager was architected to
distribute all data it stores and processes globally across the Azure
cloud.

As part of the EU Data Boundary and Microsoft\'s regional data residency
commitments,

Azure Resource Manager is being rearchitected to allow Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data to be stored and processed regionally. This
work is still in progress, and the following Azure services that depend
on Azure Resource Manager for routing capabilities will continue to
store and process Customer Data and pseudonymized personal data globally
(in any Microsoft datacenter within Azure public regions) until this

### Azure DevOps

[Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/): Azure
DevOps provides a suite of services to facilitate team development,
planning, and collaboration. DevOps transfers some Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data to the United States for authentication,
authorization and performance, and health measurement purposes. When
Azure DevOps customers use the Token feature and issue Personal Access
Tokens (PAT), or provide Secure Shell (SSH) Keys, such data is
transferred from the EU Data Boundary to systems within the United

States. PATs and SSH Keys are stored in the United States for as long as
the Azure DevOps organization and/or project is active, or the customer
decides to delete the PAT or SSH Keys. In addition to Customer Data
transfer with PAT and SSH keys, user email addresses are globally stored
in a US-based DevOps routing service for back-end compatibility with
public APIs that support the way user descriptors were previously stored
in Azure DevOps.

## Cloud PC

[Cloud PC:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365/overview) For
a small percentage of Cloud PC customers that purchased Windows 365
Business licenses, some of their Cloud PCs were provisioned in the UK as
it was part of the EU deployment region. Customer Data transferred: all
data, applications, and content is stored and processed in the UK.
Affected Cloud PCs are targeted to be migrated to the EU Data Boundary
by the end of February 2024.

## SharePoint

[SharePoint (legacy
infrastructure)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/): Some
SharePoint tenants for customers with an EU country or region rely upon
a legacy infrastructure management service not yet available within the
EU Data Boundary. For these customers, there are cases where a
job/service that supports customer-initiated scenarios may temporarily
access and store limited Customer Data in datacenters outside the EU
Data Boundary. Examples of Customer Data transferred: customer created
sites, folder names, or URLs that contain them may be stored and
processed worldwide. Migration of these customers to a newer
infrastructure management service within the EU Data Boundary is planned
to be completed by June 2024.

## Viva Engage (formerly called Yammer)

[Viva Engage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/engage/overview)
customers that onboarded prior to 2019 currently have their data stored
in North America. Microsoft will publish a plan for migrating these
customers by the end of the year. Until migration, all Customer Data for
these affected customers will continue to be transferred to, stored, and
processed in North America. This also applies to the same customers
using Viva Answers, which is part of Viva Engage.

A copy of Viva Engage reactions data (for example, likes of Viva Engage
posts) is currently stored with a third-party subprocessor, Snowflake,
Inc., which processes data in the United States. The Engage team is
working on a plan to keep reactions data within the EU by mid-2025.

Pseudonymized personal data about a user's interactions with Viva Engage
(for example, a user navigating from one page to another or performing a
scroll action on a feed) will be stored in North America through
December 31, 2024.

## Viva Insights

**Services excluded from the EU Data Boundary**

Article • 01/02/2024

While the majority of Microsoft\'s enterprise online services in the
Azure, Dynamics 365,

Power Platform, and Microsoft 365 service families are in-scope for the
EU Data Boundary, subject to the continuing flows of Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data related to operation and use of the services
detailed in other EU Data Boundary articles or sections in this
documentation, some services in these families aren\'t in scope for the
EU Data Boundary, typically where the nature of the service and the
customer value it provides can\'t be delivered by implementing a
regionalized architecture. In this documentation, we describe primary
examples of services in this category. This list is non-exhaustive and
may be updated over time. The Product Terms portion of the services
agreement is the definitive source for determining whether a given
service is an EU Data Boundary Service.

# Azure services

## Azure Front Door (AFD) and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)

[Azure Front Door and Content Delivery
Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/) transfer
Customer Data from the EU. Azure Front Door and Content Delivery Network
are non-regional services that can be used to bring customers\' static
and dynamic content closer to their end users all over the world. To
help accelerate global requests, Azure Front Door and Azure CDN cache
data at global edge locations on behalf of the customer. Both services
use a networking technique called anycast to direct traffic between
customer end users and point of presence (PoP) locations using the
fastest possible route. Due to the nature of this routing mechanism and
in order to serve our customers\' requirements to push data around the
world, not all traffic will stay within the EU Data Boundary. Cached
content duration can be changed based on a customer\'s configuration
within the AFD or CDN profile settings.

## Windows 10 IoT Core Services

[Windows 10 IoT Core
Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/manufacture/iotcoreservicesoverview)
transfers Customer Data from the EU. Windows 10 IoT Core Services is a
global software update distribution service that hosts Customer Data to
be distributed to our customers\' own customers. The service enables
customers to update their managed IoT devices using the global Windows
Update content delivery network (CDN), and it allows for their custom
content and Microsoft\'s Windows IoT software updates to be delivered as
a Windows Update. To provide this capability, Customer Data is stored in
both Azure Storage and across the world in the servers that support
Windows Update. Customer Data transferred globally includes all data
customers upload in their Board-Supported-Package (BSP), which can
contain custom drivers, applications, and other data targeted for the
device update.

# Microsoft 365 services

## Microsoft 365 Applications

[Microsoft 365
Applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/) (for

December 31, 2022. Customers using older builds should upgrade to the
latest version.

# Security services

Microsoft security services help protect customers from the latest
malware attacks, whether protecting their endpoints, cloud workloads, or
their email and collaboration software. Examples of customer-facing
security capabilities generated by Microsoft security services through
usage of cross-boundary signals include:

> **Protection against sophisticated modern security threats**:
> Microsoft uses advanced analytics capabilities, including artificial
> intelligence, to analyze globally aggregated security-related data.
> This helps prevent, detect, investigate, respond to, and remediate
> threats. Without this centralized analytics capability across global
> data, the efficacy of these services would degrade significantly,
> preventing Microsoft from providing the necessary levels of protection
> to customers. **Detecting a compromised enterprise user**: Microsoft
> helps detect identity compromise by tracking suspicious account logins
> from multiple geo regions within a brief period. This is known as
> *impossible travel* attacks. To enable this type of protection,
> Microsoft security services centrally process global Microsoft Entra
> authentication logs.
>
> **Detecting data exfiltration**: Microsoft can help alert customers to
> potential data leakage from the enterprise by aggregating several
> signals of malicious access to data storage from various locations, a
> technique used by malicious actors to fly under the detection radar
> (known as *low* and *slow* attacks).

## Microsoft Defender XDR

[Microsoft Defender
XDR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/)
is a unified pre-and post-breach enterprise defense suite that natively
coordinates detection, prevention, and response across endpoints,
identities, emails, and applications to provide integrated protection
against sophisticated attacks. Microsoft Defender XDR services require
operations of global systems including artificial intelligence,
automation, and humans on global data sets to hunt global customer
threats. Human security researchers and analysts operate the
intelligence aspect of the service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to
create new detections, signatures, and heuristics by working with data
consolidated from sites spread over the globe. Microsoft Defender XDR
services store most EU Customer Data in the EU region. Limited transfers
to the United States are encrypted during transit and storage. Access to
this Customer Data is only through a Secure Admin Workstation (SAW) with
just-in-time (JIT) access permission. For more information, visit the
[Microsoft Trust Center data location
page](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-location) and
navigate to the Microsoft Defender XDR services within cloud service
data residency and transfer policies.

The Microsoft Defender XDR services excluded from the EU Data Boundary

[Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/)
delivers full protection for software as a service (SaaS) applications,
helping monitor and protect cloud app data through advanced threat
protection. SaaS apps are ubiquitous across hybrid work environments,
and protecting SaaS apps and the important data they store is a big
challenge for organizations. The rise in app usage, combined with
employees accessing company resources outside of the corporate perimeter
has introduced new attack vectors. To combat these attacks effectively,
security teams rely on Defender for Cloud Apps to protect their data
within cloud apps beyond the traditional scope of cloud access security
brokers (CASBs). Defender for Cloud Apps shows the full picture of risks
to an environment from SaaS app usage and provides control of what's

tools, and automated investigation and response capabilities. Since
malicious threats are rarely restricted to a single region, Microsoft
Defender for Office 365 requires globally distributed human security
researchers to analyze data holistically and globally with most data
transferred and stored in the United States. The data Microsoft Defender
for Office 365 collects for security analysis, such as sender/recipient
email address, email headers including IP address of sender, URLs
included in email content, and scrubbed/obfuscated subject lines are
encrypted so security researchers and engineers cannot access the
content in a human-readable way.

## Microsoft Cloud Security

The suite of Microsoft Cloud Security services provides security posture
management and threat protection for customers\' workloads running in
Azure, hybrid, and other cloud platforms, including Internet of Things
(IoT) devices. These are global services, providing real-time alerts and
security recommendations for customers\' cloud resources. Cloud Security
services store most Customer Data of EU customers in the EU region with
limited transfers that are stored in the United States. Cloud Security
services strictly control data with restricted role-based access
controls (RBAC), Secure Admin

Workstations (SAW), and just-in-time (JIT) access permission. Data
transfer is encrypted on the wire and data storage is instrumented for
continuous monitoring and detections.

**Configuring Azure non-regional services for the EU Data Boundary**

Article • 01/02/2024

[Azure non-regional services (you can find a complete list at Azure
Products by Region) are services that have no dependency on a specific
Azure region
and](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?regions=non-regional&products=all)
don\'t currently let customers specify a deployment region. These
services were architected and optimized to be always available as part
of Azure\'s global cloud. As part of the EU Data Boundary commitment to
meet the data residency requirements of EU customers, many of these
services and core components of the Azure platform that support them are
being rearchitected. This work, some of which involves extensive service
and platform rearchitecting, is ongoing. Some Azure non-regional
services have completed this work; for others, work is ongoing, and the
services will be available in the EU Data Boundary on varying schedules
throughout 2024. This documentation lists Azure nonregional services
that have already met the EU Data Boundary commitment and describes how
to configure the services to store and process Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data in the EU Data Boundary. To learn more about
Azure nonregional services with residual data transfers outside of the

[Alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview)
and [Action
Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups)
are built on a Log Analytics Workspace or an Application

Insights resource, which are both Geo-aligned. Data sent by a customer
to an Action Groups endpoint in the EU is stored in the EU and uses an
EU-based SMS system when an alert is triggered to send an email, text,
or phone call.

This workflow stores and processes all Customer Data and pseudonymized
personal data in the EU when run fully within the EU. If an engineer
creates a resource outside of the EU, for instance in East US, and the
monitoring for this workflow is also set up in East US, the Alert
workflow runs in the US, even if notifications are sent to partners in
the EU.

### Log Analytics

[Log
Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)
is an Azure regional service that stores and processes all Customer Data

Analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/change/change-analysis)
builds on Azure Resource Graph to provide insights into changes across
multiple infrastructure and application deployment layers. Change
analysis data is currently stored and processed globally, but in the
future, it will move to a regional model. For more information, see
Services that will temporarily transfer a subset of Customer Data or
pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data Boundary.

### Applications Insights

[Application
Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
is an Azure regional service that stores and processes all Customer Data
in the Geo selected when you create the service. Work is in progress to
store and process pseudonymized personal data in the EU Data Boundary as
described in Services that will temporarily transfer a subset of
Customer Data or pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data
Boundary.

# Additional non-regional services that are available in the EU Data Boundary

All of these services can be configured to be used in the EU Data
Boundary. The following sections describe how to configure the listed
non-regional services to store and process Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data in the EU Data Boundary.

Configuration details for each service are described in the following
sections.

## Azure Bot Service

[Azure Bot
Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/) provides
a collection of libraries, tools, and services that let you build, test,
deploy, and manage intelligent bots. The Bot Service enables you to
create a Bot within the EU Data Boundary and all the data plane related
data for your Bot is stored and processed within the EU. Customer Data
and pseudonymized personal data is stored and processed in the EU Data
Boundary aside from specific residual transfers that are documented in
Services that will temporarily transfer a subset of Customer Data or
pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data Boundary. For details
about how to add regional settings to a bot, see [Regionalization
support - Bot
Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-regionalization).

## Azure Communication Services

When creating an [Azure Communication
Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/)
resource, you specify a geography

(not an Azure region). All chat messages and resource data are stored in
that

geography, in a region selected internally by Communication Services.
Selecting the Europe geography or one of the country geographies that
are part of the EU Data Boundary ensures that your Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data is stored and processed in the EU Data
Boundary, aside from specific residual transfers that are documented in
Services that will temporarily transfer a subset of Customer Data or
pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data Boundary. For more
information, see [Region availability and data residency for Azure
Communication
Services.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/privacy)

## Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI

[Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack
HCI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/hybrid/) sends data to
the region selected when the cluster was configured. Any included
Customer Data is stored and processed in this region.

## Azure Migrate

When you create an [Azure
Migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/) project, you
specify a geography (not an Azure region). All metadata collected from
the on-premises environment is securely stored and processed in the
location you created the project. Selecting a geography in the EU
ensures that your data is stored and processed in the EU Data Boundary.
For the specific [metadata locations associated with each geography, see
Azure Migrate
supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix#public-cloud)
[geographies. For more information, see Azure Migrate appliance FAQ -
How is data
stored.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/common-questions-appliance#how-is-data-stored)

## Azure Virtual Desktop

When you create a new [Azure Virtual
Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/) host
pool, you specify the Azure region where the metadata for that host pool
is created. This determines where the information associated with the
host pool is stored, which includes a host pool or application name. If
you select either of the EU regions, this data is stored and processed
only within the EU. Microsoft doesn\'t control or limit the locations
from where you or your users can [access their Azure Virtual Desktop
Virtual Machines. For more information, see Data locations for Azure
Virtual Desktop. Customer administrators can also configure
the](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/data-locations)
transfer of files to local devices through [Configure device
redirection.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-device-redirections)

## Azure VM Image Builder

[Azure VM
Builder:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/image-builder-overview?tabs=azure-powershell)
For virtual machine (VM) image templates created in an EU region,
[storage and processing of data occurs in the EU. For more information,
see Create an Azure Image Builder Bicep file or ARM JSON
template.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json?tabs=json%2Cazure-powershell#data-residency)

## Cloud Shell

[Cloud
Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview) is
an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible terminal for managing

Azure resources. Cloud Shell enables you to create new storage within
the EU Data Boundary by selecting a Cloud Shell region in the EU Data
Boundary. Customer Data is not stored or processed in Cloud Shell and
pseudonymized personal data is stored and processed in the EU Data
Boundary aside from specific residual transfers that are documented in
Services that will temporarily transfer a subset of Customer Data or
pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data Boundary. For more
information, see [Persist files in Azure Cloud
Shell.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/persisting-shell-storage)

## Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Active Directory B2C

[Microsoft Entra
ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis) and
[Azure Active Directory
B2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview):
A Microsoft Entra tenant contains a directory for managing users and
provides identity and access management (IAM) capabilities to
applications and resources used by your organization. When creating a
Microsoft Entra tenant, you specify a geography (not an Azure region) as
your Location. When you select a Location that is part of the EU Data
Boundary, your Customer Data and pseudonymized personal data is stored
and processed in the EU Data Boundary, aside from specific residual
transfers that are documented in the following locations:

> Services that transfer a subset of Customer Data or pseudonymized
> personal data out of the EU Data Boundary on an ongoing basis
>
> Services that will temporarily transfer a subset of Customer Data or
> pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data Boundary
>
> Optional service capabilities that transfer Customer Data or
> pseudonymized personal data out of the EU Data Boundary

For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Microsoft
Entra
ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/create-new-tenant).
You can verify your Microsoft Entra directory data location through
Microsoft Entra admin center by navigating to the Properties page and
ensuring the associated country or region value is part of the EU Data
Boundary.

## Microsoft Fabric

For [Microsoft
Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview),
the geographic area (Geo) in which a customer\'s services tenancy is
[hosted is determined by the first user that signs up. For more
information, see Power BI implementation planning: Tenant setup.
Customers can configure their service to be
in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-implementation-planning-tenant-setup#home-region)scope
for the EU Data Boundary by provisioning their tenant and all Microsoft
Fabric capacities in an EU datacenter location. Customer Data and
pseudonymized personal data is stored and processed in the EU Data
Boundary aside from specific residual transfers that are documented in
Services that transfer a subset of Customer Data or pseudonymized
personal data out of the EU Data Boundary on an ongoing basis.

Fabric also enables the option to select an Azure region where Customer
Data is stored when creating new Microsoft Fabric capacity. The default
option listed is your tenant home region. If you select that region, all
associated data, including Customer Data, is stored in that Geo. If you
select a different region, some Customer Data is still stored in the
home Geo. By selecting a region in the EU, Customer Data will be stored
in the EU Data Boundary.

> To find the home region for your tenant, see [Find your Fabric home
> region.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/find-fabric-home-region)
> For more information about changing location using the Multi-Geo
> option and about what information is stored in the new Geo versus your
> home Geo, see [Configure Multi-Geo support for Fabric
> Premium](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/service-admin-premium-multi-geo).

## Power BI Embedded

[Power BI
Embedded](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/)
analytics allows you to embed Power BI items such as reports,
dashboards, and tiles in a web application or in a website. When you
create a new Power BI Embedded resource, you can select the Azure region
where you would like your workspace data and content for the capacity to
be stored. The default option listed is your tenant home region; if you
select that region, all of your data and content is stored in that Geo.
If you select a different region, some data and content is still stored
in the home Geo.

## Translator

For customers who require data to be stored and processed within the EU,
[Translator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/)
provides a European endpoint
(api-eur.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com). When using the Translator
European endpoint, requests are processed by datacenters within the EU
Data Boundary only. If no datacenter within the EU Data Boundary is
available, the request isn\'t processed, and an error is returned. All
requests sent to the European endpoint are processed in the EU only,
even if the request originates from outside the EU. For more
information, see [Translator V3.0 Reference - Azure Cognitive
Services.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#base-urls)
