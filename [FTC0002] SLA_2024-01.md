## **Introduction**

**About this Document**

This Service Level Agreement for Microsoft Online Services (this "SLA") is a part of your Microsoft volume licensing agreement (the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this SLA will have the meaning assigned to them in the Agreement. This SLA applies to the Microsoft Online Services listed herein (a "Service" or the "Services"), but does not apply to separately branded services made available with or connected to the Services or to any on-premise software that is part of any Service.

If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of your monthly service fees. We will not modify the terms of your SLA during the initial term of your subscription; however, if you renew your subscription, the version of this SLA that is current at the time of renewal will apply throughout your renewal term. We will provide at least 90 days' notice for adverse material changes to this SLA. You can review the most current version of this SLA at any time by visiting [https://aka.ms/CSLA](https://aka.ms/CSLA).

Previews and Online Services and/or service tiers provided free of charge are not included or eligible for SLA claims or credits.

**Prior Versions of this Document**

This SLA provides information on Services currently available. Earlier versions of this document are available at [http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/). To find the needed version, a customer may contact its reseller or Microsoft Account Manager.

**Clarifications and Summary of Changes to this Document**

Below are recent additions, deletions and other changes to this SLA. Also listed below, are clarifications of Microsoft policy in response to common customer questions.

## **General Terms**

**Definitions**

" **Applicable Period**" means, for the 30 days prior to and including the last day of the Incident for which a Service Credit is owed, the number of days that you are a subscriber for a Service.

" **Applicable Service Fees**" means the total fees actually paid by you for a Service that are applied to the Applicable Period in which a Service Credit is owed.

" **Downtime**" is defined for each Service in the Services Specific Terms below. Except for Microsoft Azure Services, Downtime does not include Scheduled Downtime. Downtime does not include unavailability of a Service due to limitations described below and in the Services Specific Terms.

" **Error Code**" means an indication that an operation has failed, such as an HTTP status code in the 5xx range.

" **External Connectivity**" is bi-directional network traffic over supported protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS that can be sent and received from a public IP address.

" **Incident**" means (i) any single event, or (ii) any set of events, that result in Downtime.

" **Management Portal**" means the web interface, provided by Microsoft, through which customers may manage the Service.

" **Scheduled Downtime**" means periods of Downtime related to network, hardware, or Service maintenance or upgrades. We will publish notice or notify you at least five (5) days prior to the commencement of such Downtime.

" **Service Credit**" is the percentage of the Applicable Service Fees credited to you following Microsoft's claim approval.

" **Service Level**" means the performance metric(s) set forth in this SLA that Microsoft agrees to meet in the delivery of the Services.

" **Service Resource**" means an individual resource available for use within a Service.

" **Success Code**" means an indication that an operation has succeeded, such as an HTTP status code in the 2xx range.

" **Support Window**" refers to the period of time during which a Service feature or compatibility with a separate product or service is supported.

" **User Minutes**" means the total number of minutes in an Applicable Period, less all Scheduled Downtime, multiplied by the total number of users.

**Terms**

**Claims**

In order for Microsoft to consider a claim, you must submit the claim to customer support at Microsoft Corporation including all information necessary for Microsoft to validate the claim, including but not limited to: (i) a detailed description of the Incident; (ii) information regarding the time and duration of the Downtime; (iii) the number and location(s) of affected users (if applicable); and (iv) descriptions of your attempts to resolve the Incident at the time of occurrence.

For a claim related to Microsoft Azure, we must receive the claim within two months of the end of the Applicable Period in which the Incident that is the subject of the claim occurred. For claims related to all other Services, we must receive the claim by the end of the Applicable Period following the month in which the Incident occurred. For example, if the Incident occurred on February 15th, we must receive the claim and all required information by March 31st.

We will evaluate all information reasonably available to us and make a good faith determination of whether a Service Credit is owed. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process claims during the subsequent month and within forty-five (45) days of receipt. You must be in compliance with the Agreement in order to be eligible for a Service Credit. If we determine that a Service Credit is owed to you, we will apply the Service Credit to your Applicable Service Fees.

If you purchased more than one Service (not as a suite), then you may submit claims pursuant to the process described above as if each Service were covered by an individual SLA. For example, if you purchased both Exchange Online and SharePoint Online (not as part of a suite), and during the term of the subscription an Incident caused Downtime for both Services, then you could be eligible for two separate Service Credits (one for each Service), by submitting two claims under this SLA. In the event that more than one Service Level for a particular Service is not met because of the same Incident, you must choose only one Service Level under which to make a claim based on the Incident. Unless as otherwise provided in a specific SLA, only one Service Credit is permitted per Service for an Applicable Period.

**Service Credits**

Service Credits are your sole and exclusive remedy for any performance or availability issues for any Service under the Agreement and this SLA. You may not unilaterally offset your Applicable Service Fees for any performance or availability issues.

Service Credits apply only to fees paid for the particular Service, Service Resource, or Service tier for which a Service Level has not been met. In cases where Service Levels apply to individual Service Resources or to separate Service tiers, Service Credits apply only to fees paid for the affected Service Resource or Service tier, as applicable. The Service Credits awarded in any billing month for a particular Service or Service Resource will not, under any circumstance, exceed your monthly service fees for that Service or Service Resource, as applicable, in the Applicable Period.

If you purchased Services as part of a suite or other single offer, the Applicable Service Fees and Service Credit for each Service will be pro-rated.

Services purchased through Reserved Instances or Azure Savings Plans are eligible for Service Credits if the Service has an eligible SLA.

If you purchased a Service from a reseller, you will receive a service credit directly from your reseller and the reseller will receive a Service Credit directly from us. The Service Credit will be based on the estimated retail price for the applicable Service, as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.

**Limitations**

This SLA and any applicable Service Levels do not apply to any performance or availability issues:

1. Due to factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);
2. That result from the use of services, hardware, or software not provided by us, including, but not limited to, issues resulting from inadequate bandwidth or related to third-party software or services;
3. That results from failures in a single Microsoft Datacenter location, when your network connectivity is explicitly dependent on that location in a non-geo-resilient manner;
4. Caused by your use of a Service after we advised you to modify your use of the Service, if you did not modify your use as advised;
5. During or with respect to preview, pre-release, beta or trial versions of a Service, feature or software (as determined by us) or to purchases made using Microsoft subscription credits;
6. That result from your unauthorized action or lack of action when required, or from your employees, agents, contractors, or vendors, or anyone gaining access to our network by means of your passwords or equipment, or otherwise resulting from your failure to follow appropriate security practices;
7. That result from your failure to adhere to any required configurations, use supported platforms, follow any policies for acceptable use, or your use of the Service in a manner inconsistent with the features and functionality of the Service (for example, attempts to perform operations that are not supported) or inconsistent with our published guidance;
8. That result from faulty input, instructions, or arguments (for example, requests to access files that do not exist);
9. That result from your attempts to perform operations that exceed prescribed quotas or that resulted from our throttling of suspected abusive behavior;
10. Due to your use of Service features that are outside of associated Support Windows; or
11. For licenses reserved, but not paid for, at the time of the Incident.
12. Your initiated operations such as restart, stop, start, failover, scale compute, and scale storage that incur downtime are excluded from the uptime calculation.
13. Monthly maintenance window that incurs a downtime to patch your server and infrastructure is excluded from the uptime calculation.

Services purchased through Open, Open Value, and Open Value Subscription volume licensing agreements, and Services in an Office 365 Small Business Premium suite purchased in the form of a product key are not eligible for Service Credits based on service fees. For these Services, any Service Credit that you may be eligible for will be credited in the form of service time (i.e., days) as opposed to service fees, and any references to "Applicable Service Fees" is deleted and replaced by "Applicable Period."

**On Demand Capacity Reservations for Azure Virtual Machines**

**Additional Definitions**

" **Availability Zone**" is a fault-isolated area within an Azure region, providing redundant power, cooling, and networking.

" **Capacity**" is a property of an On Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the quantity of Virtual Machine instances reserved

" **On Demand Capacity Reservation**" is an object created in an Azure subscription to express a quantity of reserved capacity for a specific Virtual Machine instance type in a specific location.

" **Virtual Machine**" refers to persistent instance types that can be deployed individually, or as part of a Virtual Machine Scale Set, in a multi-tenant environment in Azure.

" **Virtual Machines Allocated**" is a property of an On Demand Capacity Reservation; this refers to the list of Virtual Machines allocated to the On Demand Capacity Reservation.

" **Supported Deployment**" is a Virtual Machine deployment that matches the location, including Availability Zone if defined, uses the exact Virtual Machine size of an existing On Demand Capacity Reservation, and complies with the [usage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview?tabs=cli1#limitations-and-restrictions) of the feature.

" **Reserved Unit**" is exactly one instance of an On Demand Capacity Reservation. For example, if an On Demand Capacity Reservation specifies a Capacity of 10 Virtual Machines, then there are 10 Reserved Units.

" **Unused Capacity Reservation**" is an On Demand Capacity Reservation with the count of Virtual Machines Allocated less than the Capacity.

" **Not Available for Deployment**" is defined as any Supported Deployment configured to consume an existing Unused Capacity Reservation that meets two conditions:

  1. Receives an error that specifies lack of Virtual Machine capacity. A Virtual Machine deployment failure for other error types or due to lack of capacity for disks or any other Azure resource does not meet this requirement; and
  2. On Demand Capacity Reservation continues to meet the definition of Unused Capacity Reservation (e.g., other Virtual Machine(s) did not already consume the Unused Capacity Reservation).

**Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for On Demand Capacity Reservation**

" **Minutes not Available**" is defined as minutes an Unused Capacity Reservation is Not Available for Deployment. From the time a Not Available for Deployment condition occurs, Minutes not Available will accumulate until (a) a subsequent Supported Deployment succeeds, (b) another Not Available for Deployment condition results from another Supported Deployment attempt, or (c) 15 minutes has elapsed. If 15 minutes elapses with no Supported Deployment attempted, then Minutes not Available will resume accumulation upon a subsequent Not Available for Deployment condition.

The Minutes not Available will accumulate for each Reserved Unit that cannot be used. If one Reserved Unit becomes used while another remains unused, then Minutes not Available will continue to accumulate only for the unused Reserved Unit.

See [example calculation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview#sla-for-capacity-reservation) in the feature documentation.

" **Downtime**" is the total accumulated Minutes not Available that are part of minutes in a given month calculated per Reserved Unit.

2. Transaction requests having timeouts set lower than the respective Maximum Processing Times specified above.
3. Read transactions requests to RA-GRS Accounts for which you did not attempt to execute the request against Secondary Region associated with the storage account if the request to the Primary Region was not successful.
4. Read transaction requests to RA-GRS Accounts that fail due to Geo-Replication Lag.

" **Geo Replication Lag**" for GRS and RA-GRS Accounts is the time it takes for data stored in the Primary Region of the storage account to replicate to the Secondary Region of the storage account. Because GRS and RA-GRS Accounts are replicated asynchronously to the Secondary Region, data written to the Primary Region of the storage account will not be immediately available in the Secondary Region. You can query the Geo Replication Lag for a storage account, but Microsoft does not provide any guarantees as to the length of any Geo Replication Lag under this SLA.

"**Geographically Redundant Storage (GRS) Account**" is a storage account for which data is replicated synchronously within a Primary Region and then replicated asynchronously to a Secondary Region. You cannot directly read data from or write data to the Secondary Region associated with GRS Accounts.

"**Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) Account**" is a storage account for which data is replicated synchronously only within a Primary Region.

" **Primary Region**" is a geographical region in which data within a storage account is located, as selected by you when creating the storage account. You may execute write requests only against data stored within the Primary Region associated with storage accounts.

"**Read Access Geographically Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) Account**" is a storage account for which data is replicated synchronously within a Primary Region and then replicated asynchronously to a Secondary Region. You can directly read data from, but cannot write data to, the Secondary Region associated with RA-GRS Accounts.

" **Secondary Region**" is a geographical region in which data within a GRS or RA-GRS Account is replicated and stored, as assigned by Microsoft Azure based on the Primary Region associated with the storage account. You cannot specify the Secondary Region associated with storage accounts.

" **Total Storage Transactions**" is the set of all storage transactions, other than Excluded Transactions, attempted within a one-hour interval across all storage accounts in the Storage Service in a given subscription.

"**Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) Account**" is a storage account for which data is replicated across multiple facilities. These facilities may be within the same geographical region or across two geographical regions.
